    <h2 style = "font-size:250%;">What are Bacterias?</h2>
    <p style = "font-size:150%;">Bacteria  (common noun bacteria, singular bacterium) are a type of biological cell. They constitute a large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms. Typically a few micrometres in length, bacteria have a number of shapes, ranging from spheres to rods and spirals. Bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on Earth, and are present in most of its habitats. Bacteria inhabit soil, water, acidic hot springs, radioactive waste, and the deep portions of Earth's crust. Bacteria also live in symbiotic and parasitic relationships with plants and animals. Most bacteria have not been characterised, and only about half of the bacterial phyla have species that can be grown in the laboratory.The study of bacteria is known as bacteriology, a branch of microbiology.</p>
    <h2 style = "font-size:250%;">Classifications of Bacterias</h2>
    <p style = "font-size: 150%;">Classification of bacteria can be done on basis of followings:</p>
    <ul>
      <li style = "font-size: 150%;"> on the basis of mode of nutrition</li>
      <li style = "font-size: 150%;"> on the basis of optimum temperature requirement for growth</li>
      <li style = "font-size: 150%;">on the basis of optimal pH for growth</li>
      <li style = "font-size: 150%;">on the basis of salt concentration</li>
      <li style = "font-size: 150%;">on the basis of gaseous requirement</li>
      <li style = "font-size: 150%;">on the basis of morphology</li>
      <li style = "font-size: 150%;">on the basis of gram staining</li>
      <li style = "font-size: 150%;">on the basis of flagella </li>
      <li style = "font-size: 150%;">on the basis of spore</li>
    </ul>
